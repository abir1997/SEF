How the program is extensible and maintainable:

* used proper names for variables to make the program more readable.

* commenting the code

* Using Enums for menu options to easily extend and modify the text and the options

* Avoiding magic text/numbers and usiong constants to improve readability and maintainability

* Using Constants from a specific Const class to have program wide constants in one place for easy access and change. 
	(These can be further externalised in a text file and read when the application starts)


* using junit tests for regression testing the application.

* using MVC pattern to seperate the concerns. Seperated into 
	The menu and user interactions are separate (user input)
	System controller and Data access layer 
	Model classes (Customer, CreditCard etc)
	
* separated application functions by splitting them into small cohesive functions looking after a specific activity to avoid duplication of the code that makes it more difficult to maintain

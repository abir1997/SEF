How the program is extensible and maintainable:

* Using Enums for menu options to easily extend and modify the text and the options

* Using Constants in an external class. Avoiding magic text/numbers to improve readability and maintainability

* using junit tests for regression testing the application.

* using MVC pattern to seperate the concerns. Seperated into 
	The menu and user interactions are separate (user input)
	System controller and Data access layer 
	Model classes (Customer, CreditCard etc)
